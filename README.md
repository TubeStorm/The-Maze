The Maze is a two player, horror game. You and your opponent chase each other through the maze and trying to kill each other. All you have is one ax that you have to pick up each time it is thrown, and a bear trap that stuns your opponent, but it does have a cool down. 

This game was created in Unity by a team of 4. 

Environment model created in Autodesk Maya.

I worked primarily on the Graphics and Modeling of the Environment and its Props. 
Assisted with coding when neccessary.
